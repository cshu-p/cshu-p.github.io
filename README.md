# Testing Personal Website
This page is an experiment on how to create my personal website using github using primarily markdown.

# About Myself
My email address is: czhng110@illinois.edu
I ask [Google](https://www.google.com) when I don't know something.

I can write python code
```python
print('Goodmorning')
```

# Testing HTML
I am using the following code from [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

# Good Man
Here is a character I like from Naruto
